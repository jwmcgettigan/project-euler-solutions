-------------------------------------------------------

I haven't the first clue of how to otherwise bound this problem
so I'm going to use the told limit of 11 primes as my bound.
(i.e. keep searching until 11 truncatable primes are found)

I need functions for:
1. Traversing prime numbers.
2. Determining if a prime is 'truncatable'.
  - Can't include numbers that are a part of a larger truncatable prime.

I refer to problem '#007' for this problem's solution.

I feel like there is a way to start the range for the prime
search at a higher number than 2 after the first loop but I'm not sure
how to go about it.  I need to create a visualization of this method
to fully understand how it is actually working.

The runtime of my first solution is:
  - Python: ~1.5s
  - JavaScript: ~1s
