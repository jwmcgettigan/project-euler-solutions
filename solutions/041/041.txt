-------------------------------------------------------

The absolute upper limit is a 9 digit pandigital number: 987654321.

Looping through such a large number takes a long time so there must
be ways to optimize my approach so that the upper limit can be lowered.

Some possible approaches include:
(1) Look into special rules/properties of pandigital numbers.
(2) Look into special rules/properties of digit sums.
    [https://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/Digitsum.htm#:~:text=The%20digit%20sum%20of%20a,sum%20of%20786%20is%203.]
(3) Figure out the relationship between prime numbers and the results
   of (1) and (2).

Pandigital Numbers:


Digit Sums:
1 => 1
12 => 3
123 => 6
1234 => 10
12345 => 15
123456 => 21
1234567 => 28
12345678 => 36
123456789 => 45

Ideas:
- (Better) Go through all prime numbers and check whether each one is pandigital.
- (Bad) Go through all pandigital numbers and check whether each one is prime.
- (Maybe Good) Add all pandigital numbers to a set() and then go through all prime numbers while checking if the set() contains the prime number.
- Since I'm looking for the largest value, I should start from the largest pandigital number and work my way downwards checking if each pandigital number is prime.
