"Integral Triangle (Integer Triangle) - a triangle
all of whosesides have lengths that are integers."

"Pythagorean triple - a right angle triangle
with integral length sides."

I need a function that:
 - Finds possible solutions from a given perimeter (p).
    - I realized that I could reuse my answer to problem '#009'.


a^2 + b^2 = c^2
p = a + b + c
c > a && c > b
