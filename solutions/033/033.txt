" My thought process:
find 4 non-trivial digit-cancelling fractions
- fraction must be less than 1 in value
- numerator (n) and denomenator (d) must have a common digit
- the digit-cancelling fraction (cn/cd) must not be divisible by 10 into n/d
- the value of (cn/cd) must equal (n/d)
find the reduced denominator of the product of these 4 fractions
