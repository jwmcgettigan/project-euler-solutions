Multiplication:
 • repeated addition of a number
  Multiple:
  • the product of any quantity and an integer.
  • 'b' is a multiple of 'a' if 'b = na' for some integer 'n', which is called the multiplier.
  Product:
  • the multiple of each multiplier.
  Multiplier/Factor:
  • The number that you are multiplying by.

Division:
 • splitting into equal parts or groups.
  Divisible:
   • Capable of being divided.
  Evenly Divisible:
   • When dividing by a certain number gives a whole number answer.
   • capable of being divided by another number without a remainder.
  Divisible By:
   • The preceding number can be 'divided by' the following number.
  Divided By:
   • The preceding number divides the following number.
  Dividend/Numerator:
   • The number you are dividing.
  Divisor/Denominator:
   • The number you are 'dividing by'.
   • any number that divides another number.
   Factor:
    • a divisor that divides the number entirely and leaves no remainder.
    • all factors of a number are its divisors. But not all divisors will be factors.
  Quotient:
   • The result of division.

Product vs Multiple vs Divisor:
 • Two numbers are factors of a 'number' if their product is the 'number'.
 • The 'number' is a multiple of a factor. 
 • Each factor is a divisor of the 'number'.

Least Common Multiple:
 • The smallest positive number that is a multiple of two or more numbers.
Greatest Common Divisor/Greatest Common Factor:
 • the largest positive integer number that divides all the numbers in the set without remainder.
 • the biggest multiple of all numbers in the set.
