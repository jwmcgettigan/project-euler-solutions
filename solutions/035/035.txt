-------------------------------------------------------

I extracted from the problem the following tasks:
1. Find all primes below one million.
  - Put them into a set().
2. Loop through every prime.
  - Rotate the digits of each prime.
    - Check whether each rotated prime is also a prime. 
    - If any rotation is not a prime, then the original prime is not circular.
  - If it is not a circular prime, then continue onto the next prime.
  - If it is a circular prime, then add it to the number of circular primes.

--- Psuedocode ---
total = 0
primes = primes_below_n
for prime in primes:
  for each rotated_digit in prime:
    if rotated_digit is not prime:
      continue to the next prime
  total++
return total
