Prime Numbers:
 • are whole numbers greater than 1, that have only two factors – 1 and the number itself.
 • are divisible only by the number 1 or itself.
Composite Numbers:
 • are whole numbers that have more than two factors.
 • are divisible by more than two numbers.
 • are whole numbers that are not prime.
Factors:
 • are the numbers you multiply together to get another number.
Prime Factorization:
 • finding which prime numbers multiply together to make the original number.
Prime Factor:
 • A factor that is a prime number.
 • any of the prime numbers that can be multiplied to give the original number.
Original Number:
 • The number you are finding the factors to.

Algorithm for Prime Factorization:
#-------------------------
  Input  N
  p = 2
  Print  N & "="
  Do while N > = p * p
    If  N mod p = 0 then
      Print p & "*"
      N = N / p 
    Else
      p  = p + 1
    End  If
  Loop
  Print  N

@Justin For the algorithm above, the final value of N is the largest prime factor of Input N.
